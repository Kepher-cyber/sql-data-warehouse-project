**1. Bronze Layer:** Contains unprocessed data captured directly from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a PostgreSQL Server database in its original form.

**2. Silver Layer:** Handles data cleaning, standardization, and normalization to ensure the data is structured and ready for analysis.

**3. Gold Layer:** Stores refined, business-ready data organized in a star schema format, optimized for reporting and analytical purposes.
## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project involves:
